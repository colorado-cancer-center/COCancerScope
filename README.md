Cancer Centers, including the University of Colorado Cancer Center, need to provide 
updated and reliable information to make informed decisions about how best to 
impact care in their catchment areas. The code herein captures the disparate information
available from public sources that can inform Community Outreach and Engagement (COE)
activities. The information can also help to generate hypotheses or produce valuable
infographics about health disparities, particularly those with geographic relationships.

## Phase 1

- [ ] API development (OpenAPI)
  - [ ] Align endpoints with resources from below
- [ ] ETL from https://cancerinfocus.org/
- [ ] Feature parity with https://cancerinfocus.org/, but with Colorado focus

## Phase 2

- [ ] Use case development with COE
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Incorporate Colorado Cancer Registry data (and other internal/private data)
